description: Learn how to install Flowbite React for your Astro project and start building modern websites with a lightning fast and content-focused web framework
---

## Create project

1. Run the following command to create a new Astro project:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

2. Install `react` using the Astro CLI:

```bash
npx astro add react
```

**Note:** Make sure to answer `Yes` to all the questions.

## Setup Tailwind CSS

1. Install `tailwindcss` using the Astro CLI:

```bash
npx astro add tailwind
```

**Note:** Make sure to answer `Yes` to all the questions.

## Install Flowbite React

1. Run the following command to install `flowbite-react`:

```bash
npm i flowbite-react
```

2. Add the Flowbite plugin to `tailwind.config.mjs` and include content from `flowbite-react`:

```js {5,9}
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    // ...
    'node_modules/flowbite-react/lib/esm/**/*.js',
  ],
  plugins: [
    // ...
    require('flowbite/plugin'),
  ],
};
```

## Dark mode

In server side rendered applications, such as Astro, to avoid page flicker (if `dark` mode is set) before Astro hydrates the content, `ThemeModeScript` component must be rendered in `Head` component (see implementation below).

`ThemeModeScript` renders a script tag that sets `dark` or removes `dark` from `<html>` element before hydration occurs.

### Configure

1. Create a root layout file under `src/layouts` folder called `index.astro`:

```tsx
// src/layouts/index.astro

<html lang="en">
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <slot />
  </body>
</html>
```

2. Import and render `ThemeModeScript` in the `<head>` tag:

```tsx {4,9}
// src/layouts/index.astro

---
import { ThemeModeScript } from "flowbite-react";
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <ThemeModeScript />
  </head>
  <body>
    <slot />
  </body>
</html>
```

3. Import the newly created layout and wrap the page content with it:

```tsx {4,7-9}
// src/pages/index.astro

---
import RootLayout from "../layouts/index.astro";
---

<RootLayout>
  // ...
</RootLayout>

```

## Component hydration

By default, a UI Framework component is not hydrated in the client. If no `client:*` directive is provided, its HTML is rendered onto the page without JavaScript ([Astro - Client Directives](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives)).

To enable Flowbite React components to be interactive add `client:load`, `client:idle` or `client:visible` ([see docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientload)) as a prop.

```tsx
<DarkThemeToggle client:load />
```

## Try it out

Now that you have successfully installed Flowbite React you can start using the components from the library.

```tsx
// src/pages/index.astro

---
import { Button } from "flowbite-react";
import RootLayout from "../layouts/index.astro";
---

<RootLayout>
  <Button>Click me</Button>
</RootLayout>
```
