title: Use with Gatsby - Flowbite React
description: Learn how to install Flowbite React for your Gatsby project and start building websites with an open-source static site generator built on top of React and GraphQL
---

## Create project

1. Run the following command to create a new Gatsby project with Tailwind CSS:

```bash
npm init gatsby
```

2. Select `"Tailwind CSS"` to `"Would you like to install a styling system?"` question.

## Install Flowbite React

1. Run the following command to install `flowbite-react`:

```bash
npm i flowbite-react
```

2. Add the Flowbite plugin to `tailwind.config.js` and include content from `flowbite-react`:

```js {5,9}
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    // ...
    'node_modules/flowbite-react/lib/esm/**/*.js',
  ],
  plugins: [
    // ...
    require('flowbite/plugin'),
  ],
};
```

## Dark mode

In server side rendered applications, such as Gatsby, to avoid page flicker (if `dark` mode is set) before Gatsby hydrates the content, `ThemeModeScript` component must be rendered in `Head` component (see implementation below).

`ThemeModeScript` renders a script tag that sets `dark` or removes `dark` from `<html>` element before hydration occurs.

### Configure

To use the [Gatsby SSR APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/), create a file called `gatsby-ssr.js` in the root of your site. Export any of the APIs you wish to use in this file.

1. Create `gatsby-ssr.js` file at the root folder of the project:

```js
// gatsby-ssr.js

export const onRenderBody = ({ setPreBodyComponents }) => {
  // ...
};
```

2. Import `ThemeModeScript` and add it to `setPreBodyComponents` function inside an array:

```js {3,6}
// gatsby-ssr.js

import { ThemeModeScript } from 'flowbite-react';

export const onRenderBody = ({ setPreBodyComponents }) => {
  setPreBodyComponents([ThemeModeScript]);
};
```

## Try it out

Now that you have successfully installed Flowbite React you can start using the components from the library.

```tsx
import { Button } from 'flowbite-react';

export default function IndexPage() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
```
