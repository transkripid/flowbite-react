---

## Create project

Run the following command to create a new Create React App project:

```bash
npx create-react-app flowbite-react-cra
```

## Setup Tailwind CSS

1. Install `tailwindcss` and its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm i -D tailwindcss
```

2. Generate `tailwind.config.js` file:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

3. Add the paths to all of your template files in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js {3}
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

4. Add the `@tailwind` directives for each of Tailwind's layers to your `./src/index.css` file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Install Flowbite React

1. Run the following command to install `flowbite-react`:

```bash
npm i flowbite-react
```

2. Add the Flowbite plugin to `tailwind.config.js` and include content from `flowbite-react`:

```js {5,9}
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    // ...
    'node_modules/flowbite-react/lib/esm/**/*.js',
  ],
  plugins: [
    // ...
    require('flowbite/plugin'),
  ],
};
```

## Try it out

Now that you have successfully installed Flowbite React you can start using the components from the library.

```tsx
import { Button } from 'flowbite-react';

export default function App() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
```
