## Table of Contents

The accordion component from Flowbite React can be used to toggle the visibility of the content of each accordion panel tab by expanding the collapsing the trigger element based on multiple examples and styles.

The reactivity and state is handled by React and the components is built using the Tailwind CSS framework meaning that you can easily customize the styles and colors of the accordion.

To use the accordion component, you need to import the `<Accordion>` component from `flowbite-react`:

```jsx
'use client';

import { Accordion } from 'flowbite-react';
```

## Default accordion

Use this example of the `<Accordion>` component and the `<Accordion.Panel>` and `<Accordion.Title>` subcomponents to create an accordion with multiple panels.

<CodePreview title="Default accordion" className="dark:bg-gray-900">
  <Accordion>
    <Accordion.Panel>
      <Accordion.Title>What is Flowbite?</Accordion.Title>
      <Accordion.Content>
        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
