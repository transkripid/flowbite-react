## Table of Contents

## Toggle dark mode

Surround the contents of your app with the `<Flowbite>` component, and add the `<DarkThemeToggle>` component inside it. The `<DarkThemeToggle>` component will automatically detect the current theme and display the correct icon, and allow the user to switch between themes as they like.

```jsx
import { DarkThemeToggle, Flowbite } from 'flowbite-react';

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <Flowbite>
      ...
      <DarkThemeToggle />
      ...
    </Flowbite>
  );
}
```

<div className="h-[20vh]" />
