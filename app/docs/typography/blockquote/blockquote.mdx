import { CodePreview } from '~/app/components/code-preview';
import { Blockquote, Avatar, Rating, theme } from '~/src';

Get started with a collection of blockquote components when quoting external sources such as quotes inside an article, user reviews, and testimonials based on multiple examples of layouts, styles, and contexts.

The main `<Blockquote>` component can be used together with the `<cite>` tag or attribute to also mention the source of the quote content.

To start using the component make sure that you have imported it from Flowbite React:

```jsx
'use client';

import { Blockquote } from 'flowbite-react';
```

## Table of Contents

## Default blockquote

Use this example to quote an external source inside a `<Blockquote>` component.

<CodePreview importFlowbiteReact="Blockquote" title="Default Blockquote">
  <Blockquote>
    "Flowbite is just awesome. It contains tons of predesigned components and pages starting from login screen to
    complex dashboard. Perfect choice for your next SaaS application."
  </Blockquote>
</CodePreview>

## Solid background

This example can be used as an alternative style to the default one by applying a solid background color.

<CodePreview importFlowbiteReact="Blockquote" title="Solid background Blockquote">
  <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    Does your user know how to exit out of screens? Can they follow your intended user journey and buy something from
    the site you’ve designed? By running a usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with your
    design once it’s live.
  </p>
  <Blockquote className="my-4 border-l-4 border-gray-300 bg-gray-50 p-4 dark:border-gray-500 dark:bg-gray-800">
    "Flowbite is just awesome. It contains tons of predesigned components and pages starting from login screen to
    complex dashboard. Perfect choice for your next SaaS application."
  </Blockquote>
  First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library is not another framework. Rather, it is a set of
  components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the documentation.

## Blockquote icon

Use this example to show an icon above the blockquote text content.

<CodePreview importFlowbiteReact="Blockquote" title="Blockquote icon">
